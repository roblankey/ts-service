# TypeScript Service
[![Code Style: Google](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-google-blueviolet.svg)](https://github.com/google/gts)

Just a sample typescript service that receives requests, does some business-y things and returns JSON responses

## Side Note
If you *really* want to leverage full-on TypeScript and write classes, injectables, interfaces, orm, etc. in a NodeJS-powered
service and you picked TypeScript because you feel that you need to write them in something that looks and feels like C#, 
please consider just using .NET Core. It's a much better solution, with better support for all those things out of the box.

If, on the other hand, you just want to write some quick javascript code, but do it in a type-safe, extendable way, then
TypeScript will satisfy that need for you very well. In addition, once you get to adding a UI to it, it's only a hop, 
skip and a jump away from just writing an Angular application (hint: Angular is in TypeScript these days!)
